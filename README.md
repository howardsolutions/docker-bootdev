# DOCKER Course Notes

## Couple Moving Parts to Keep in mind

1. The "Docker server" or "Docker Daemon". 

This listens to requests from the desktop app and executes them. 

If this isn't running NOTHING ELSE will work.

2. The "Docker Desktop" GUI. 

Starting the GUI should start the server, at least that's how I usually ensure the server is running. 

The GUI is the VISUAL way to interact with Docker.

3. The Docker CLI. 

As a developer, most of your work will be interacting with Docker via the CLI. 

I'd recommend using the GUI to visualize what's going on with Docker, but executing most of your commands through the command line.
